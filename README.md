# StudyBuddy 📚✨

## Ever wished your study notes could be as organized as your playlist? 🤔

Tired of messy notes and chaotic study sessions?😒 StudyBuddy to the rescue! 🦸‍♂️ Create stunning notes in a distraction-free zone, then invite friends with a click when you're ready to collaborate. Your work stays private until YOU decide to share it! Smart organization, real-time teamwork, and version history make studying actually enjoyable! 🚀

## What makes StudyBuddy cool? 🚀

StudyBuddy isn't just another note-taking app. We built this with real student problems in mind:

- **Privacy first!** 🔒 Your notes stay private until you explicitly decide to share them
- **Clutter-free by default** 📑 A clean interface that lets you focus on what matters
- **Study together, but on your terms** 👯‍♀️ Turn collaboration on with a simple switch when you need it
- **Works offline** 🏝️ Because internet connections in lecture halls can suck sometimes
- **Your notes, your style** 🎨 Express yourself with premium decorative elements (or keep it minimal!)

## Core Features 💎

### Note Management
- Rich text editing with all the formatting options you need
- Media embedding for diagrams, images, and more

### Organization That Makes Sense

### Collaboration Without the Chaos

- Multi-file access during study sessions
